Very nice work, as always!

Good points on problem one with cost vs. schedule and overall functionality.
You make a good case for developers not being able to produce good quality
without proper funding!

Good analysis, too, on problems two and three, although there is also a
"deployment" phase in waterfall which might get lumped in to maintenance.
The fact is that the maintenance phase on a large project will consume 70%
to 80% of the project's total cost, so pulling the deployment activity out
of that can be a savings.

Good thoughtful answers to eight, nine, and ten.  Interesting that Google has
a ".BUILD" file which sounds like a "make" file from building in the "C" code
environment.  I wonder if the cyclical dependency error is similar to Sage's
project of making error messages more meaningful!

Great jobon this assignment.
