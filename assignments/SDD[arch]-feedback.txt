Very nice job on this architectural document.  The descriptions are clear
and the diagrams are excellent to convey the operational connections of the
various parts.  Nice annotations to show the references!

I like the way you "tell the story" of the operations and interactions in
secion 6.2.2 ~ that's very effective!

GREAT WORK!!
