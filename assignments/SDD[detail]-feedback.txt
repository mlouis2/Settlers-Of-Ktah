Architectural Design Section:
-----------------------------
Very nice job on this architectural document.  The descriptions are clear
and the diagrams are excellent to convey the operational connections of the
various parts.  Nice annotations to show the references!

I like the way you "tell the story" of the operations and interactions in
secion 6.2.2 ~ that's very effective!

GREAT WORK!!

Detailed Design Section:
------------------------
Nice work on this deliverable!  It took me a couple of read-throughs to get
a feel for how you presented it, but that turned out to just be me.

Remember the intent of this document is to provide the development team with
something that you can hand them and say, "go build this" and they will know
what to do, at LEAST to get started on it.

.....just sayin'......

Nice job!

            so the 15% reflects 10% for detail and 5% for CDR
