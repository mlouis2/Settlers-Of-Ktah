========================================================================================
Wow, great work on this document!  You have nailed the preliminary schedule,
and the CSCI breakdown looks near-perfect!  You don't need to put in anything
that is more than about 5 "dot levels" deep, really.  All that will come out
in the functional requirements section in 5.3.

Speaking of which, GOOD use of "will" statements.  They are usually formatted
to be on their own line UNDER the preceding "shall" statement.  They should
not be a second sentence in the same numbered paragraph, because then they
would become like a "shall" statement and you'd have to prove that it works
that way.  Break the line at the end of the "shall" statement, and put the
"will" statement underneath with no number:

5.3.1.1.2 The Game Settings menu shall allow the player to change the application settings
          Application settings include, but are not limited to:
            * Sound effects volume
            * Background music volume

Section 5.2.2 and 5.3.2 for the AWS server could use a little more "meat".
What role with the server play?  What will be stored there, or what data
will be handled?  If it is integral to the game play, in what way do the
other parts interface with it?   What data structures are passed around?

Put a little more into that part of this and it will be a STELLAR effort!
during the rest of the semester, re-visit the doc and add stuff in as it
shows up during development; treat this as a "living document"!


GREAT WORK!!
