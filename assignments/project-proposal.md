# Overview  
Settlers of K’tah is a turn-based video board game inspired by Dr. Forney’s K’tah and the board game Settlers of Catan. This game will take inspiration from Catan Universe, which is the online version of Settlers of Catan. However, there will be new features and changes to the original concept, and the theme will revolve around zombies and survival. The game will allow for multiple players to compete in order to gather resources, build up armies and defenses, and fight off a horde of zombies. This will be built in Unity 3D.
# Justification  
This project will utilize knowledge that the team learned in several different classes, as well as expand upon this knowledge. Game design and game development are both vital to this project, and Maddie was introduced to the topics in two of Josh Morgan’s classes. Networking will also be important because of the multiplayer nature of the game, and while Maddie learned about this in Dondi’s networking class, this project will be a good opportunity to expand upon this knowledge. In addition, a major expansion to the project that we hope to accomplish is the addition of AI agents that a single player would be able to play against. Merissa has taken both of Dr. Forney's AI classes, and hope to apply that knowledge in this project. 
We have recruited two animation majors to work on the graphics component of this project, which will allow for interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe that this project will have sufficient technical difficulty, as neither Merissa nor Maddie has ever built a project of this scale. However, by starting with a small, working version and building up to a more and more detailed game, we will be able to accomplish a viable product by the end of the semester. We have been talking with Dr. Forney about this project, and have numerous ideas on how to make it fun and exciting for everyone involved.
