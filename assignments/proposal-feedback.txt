CMSI 401 project ~~ Fall 2020
Maddie Louis, Merissa Tan [plus Kaitlyn Behrens, Haley Mech]
Settlers of K'tah game project
=================================
Presentation:
   nicely done presentation, with good graphics and illustrations.  I like
   the idea of combining these two games, and the potential for an AI portion
   or component is intriguing ~ much more than the previous two iterations of
   the K'tah game in which the zombies just follow you around like a mouse
   tracker.  this adds a new dimension, and having animation involved should
   give you a really significant "wow" factor to the project!

Proposal Document:
   nice job on the proposal document.  you have covered all the bases, as I
   had no doubt you would do...  :D  Linking to the detailed documentation on
   Google Drive was an inspired way to bring in those details!  I see you
   have assembled quite a team for this project, and the interdisciplinary
   nature will be a good thing!  keep in mind that the bigger the team the
   harder it may be to get everyone together for meetings, especially later
   in the semester.

Great job on this presentation and proposal!
