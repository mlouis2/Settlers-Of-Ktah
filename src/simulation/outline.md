Questions/Notes:
- Should player trade be a thing? Or just bank trade?

Components needed for simulation:
- Player
    - Resources
        - Figure out a way to trade if only one resource away from most wanted build etc. (Merissa)
    - Victory Path Points
        - Defense Points (Maddie)
        - Research Points (Merissa)
    - Num knights (Maddie)
        - Attack when horde distance is low and there's a likelihood of winning
    - Different strategy types
        - Militaristic - Build knights, outposts/roads, attacks whenever possible (Maddie)
        - ~~Research - Build outposts, barricades, knights, attacks when horde distance is 1 (Merissa)~~
        - ~~Lone Survivor - Build barricades, outposts, knights, only attacks to liberate castles (Merissa)~~
        - ~~General - Build order is random, attack somewhat randomly (Maddie)~~
- Board
    - Buildings
        - Each building has player owner
        - ~~Outpost class (Merissa)~~
        - ~~Castle class (Merissa)~~
        - ~~Roads (Maddie)~~
        - Barricades (Maddie)
            - Barricade lowers likelihood of zombie attack upon spread
            EDIT: Changed to lowering likelihood of bringing zombies closer to player
- Horde class (Maddie)
    - Size
        - As increases, horde distance for player castles has chance of decreasing
        - Spread each round
    - Player spread with spinner roll
    - Player can attack when horde distance for a castle is <= 2
- General simulation (Both)
    - Extra file to run sim.py multiple times and export to CVS/TXT file
    - Parts of a turn:
        - ~~Resource roll~~
        - ~~Possible zombie spread~~
        - ~~Build, based on strategy outlined above~~
        - ~~Maybe attack, based on strategy outlined above~~
    - Between rounds
        - Check for lone survivor
        - ~~Update barricades~~
