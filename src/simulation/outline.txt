Components needed for simulation:
- Player
    - Resources
        - Amounts
        - Bank trade for lowest resource when > ~20 of one resource
    - Victory Path Points
        - Defense Points
        - Research Points
    - Num knights
        - Attack when horde distance is low and there's a likelihood of winning
- Board
    - Buildings
        - Each building has player owner
        - Outposts / Apothecaries
            - Collection amounts
            - When built, increases total collection amounts
        - Castles
            - Horde distance
        - Roads / Barricades
            - Barricade lowers likelihood of zombie attack upon spread
- Horde
    - Size
        - As increases, horde distance for player castles has chance of decreasing
        - Spread each round
