Questions/Notes:
- Should player trade be a thing? Or just bank trade?

Components needed for simulation:
- Player
    - Resources
        - Bank trade for lowest resource when > ~20 of one resource (Merissa)
    - Victory Path Points
        - Defense Points (Maddie)
        - Research Points (Merissa)
    - Num knights (Maddie)
        - Attack when horde distance is low and there's a likelihood of winning
    - Different strategy types
        - Militaristic - Build knights, outposts/roads, attacks whenever possible (Maddie)
        - Research - Build outposts, barricades, knights, attacks when horde distance is 1 (Merissa)
        - Lone Survivor - Build barricades, outposts, knights, only attacks to liberate castles (Merissa)
        - General - Build order is random, attack somewhat randomly (Maddie)
- Board
    - Buildings
        - Each building has player owner
        - Roads (Maddie)
            - Don't do anything except allow you to build more outposts
        - Barricades (Maddie)
            - Barricade lowers likelihood of zombie attack upon spread
- Horde class (Maddie)
    ~~- Size~~
        ~~- As increases, horde distance for player castles has chance of decreasing~~
        ~~- Spread each round~~
    - Player spread with spinner roll
    - Player can attack when horde distance for a castle is < 2
- General simulation (Both)
    - Extra file to run sim.py multiple times and export to CVS/TXT file
    - Parts of a turn:
        - Resource roll
        - Possible zombie spread
        - Build, based on strategy outlined above
        - Maybe attack, based on strategy outlined above
    - Between rounds
        - Check for lone survivor
        - Update barricades
